Every event in the life of a character has some effect on his main characteristics - tobacco addiction, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, wealth, health, sadness, spirituality and wisdom. Excess comes at a price, though, and when a characteristic gets too high, it cancels another one - if you smoke too much, you get thin; if you get too fat, you must stop drinking; if you drink too much you lose your wisdom, and so on - once more, very realistic.

The world of BattleLore meshes history and fantasy together - putting players in command of an array of miniature troops on the battlefields of a Medieval Europe Uchronia at the outset of the Hundred Years War.

In this fantastical re-imagining of the Hundred Years War, French and English armies are supplemented with Goblins and Dwarves mercenaries and even some creatures like Giant Spider and Earth Elemental!

In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.<BR><BR>The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council. Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.<BR><BR>Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn.<BR><BR>At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.<BR><BR>Many alternate strategies are possible to win: will you go for the military way, disregarding economic and prestige buildings, or will you aim to complete the big Cathedral to please the King?

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<BR><BR>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).<BR><BR>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events which could possibly have happened) which cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay.

It is compatible with Arkham Horror - Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion.<BR><BR><I>Once again, terror has come to New England, this time spreading to the small country town of Dunwich, just a few miles from Arkham. The area is filled with rolling hills, many of which are topped with mysterious stone circles or the ramshackle houses of the recluses who live outside of town. At night, the piping of the whippoorwills fills the air, while lightning bugs dance in the witch-haunted hallows. This is a place where dark pacts with unknown forces are made, and where city folk go to disappear without a trace.

Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.<BR><BR>Rulebook and Playbook:<BR>The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples.

Kennedy<BR><BR>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new ""superpowers"" scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<BR><BR>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower.

"GMT 0512","Here I Stand","Here I Stand: Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555 is the first game in over 25 years to cover the political and religious conflicts of early 16th Century Europe. Few realize that the greatest feats of Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, Ignatius Loyola, Henry VIII, Charles V, Francis I, Suleiman the Magnificent, Ferdinand Magellan, Hernando Cortes, and Nicolaus Copernicus all fall within this narrow 40-year period of history. This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.<BR><BR>There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory :<BR>The Ottomans<BR>The Habsburgs<BR>The English<BR>The Valois Dynasty of France<BR>The Papacy<BR>The Protestants<BR><BR>Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccolo Machiavelli published his masterpiece ""The Prince,"" backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.<BR><BR>Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3-4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.","hereistand.jpg","",100.00,0,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-09-02 00:12:00,"GMT Games",Inactive,0,0,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games","War Games",,,,,,

The variation in this edition is when you send your little ships out across the final frontier.<BR><BR.Each player has a huge mother ship to which they attach their bits. You can buy, earn, and win more engines, to go faster; cargo bays, to enable trading with aliens; guns, to fight off pirates; and little discs to show your reputation.<BR><BR>Where the flames for the rocket would be is a small clear bubble. Shake your mother ship and put it down and two colored balls fall into the bubble. If the are red, yellow or blue, your little ships move across the board. But if one is black, you face an adventure card. (A similar mechanism is used in Ab Die Post).<BR><BR>Another player draws and reads you the adventure, and you must make simple yes/no choices. A flowchart on each card reveals the consequences, some good, some bad, and often you shake your ships to see what happens. Roughly though, pirates try to rob resources and if you win a fight you keep your cards and gain reputation (worth VPs). Or traders welcome resources and give you good stuff and reputation in return. But if you flee the pirates or stiff the traders, you lose stuff and lose reputation. There are also wormholes and wandering folk.<BR><BR>If you land a trading ship at an alien planet, you befriend the aliens and gain VPs, and cards which enhance your game. If you land a colony, you increase your chances of collecting resources and gain 1 VP. If you turn a colony into a port, you can start your ships from there instead and gain an extra VP for it.

"RGG 170","Carcassonne","In this fairly light tile-laying offering, players pull a tile from the pool and place it against one of the previously played tiles. If you start a new object (city, road, farm, or monastery), you can place one of your control markers on the tile to denote your control. Markers (called Followers by the publisher and called Meeples by us) cannot directly compete when placed, so to achieve some gains, you must place your marker and use later tiles to connect up to it.<BR><BR>As subsequent tiles are arrayed on the board, objects get bigger or even merge. When roads or cities are completed, or a monastery is surrounded, the control marker is returned to you and you score the points. However, farmers are not returned and will score points at the game end (there are several rules variations for the farmer scoring).<BR><BR>Therefore, it's possible to have all of your control markers locked on the board on incomplete objects, and not be able to convert them into farmers later in the game. You must balance the need to score points during the game with the need to score farmer points at game end.<BR><BR>The goal is to have the most points at the end, which can be tricky to control considering your choice for each turn isn't the tile itself, but rather the placement of the tile that you drew.

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.<BR><BR>Each turn begins with an auction phase where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned has the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you.<BR><BR>After the auction, players get three actions to improve their plantations. Actually, plantations are one of the things that can be bought at the auctions, and doing so is necessary to get anywhere. There are five different types of spice plantation, and different spices are needed for different things.<BR><BR>Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player that reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them.

However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you're potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable 'renewable energy' wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.","powergrid.jpg","",61.80,4,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-09-02 00:12:00,"Rio Grande Games",Active,2,6,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,2,"Board Games",,,,,,,

The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, he must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.<BR><BR>As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.<BR><BR>This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower).

As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.<BR><BR>The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960 a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon's lazy shave, President Eisenhower's late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state_s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<BR><BR>As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you.

However, there is no board or score track and the tactical nuts and bolts of the game are somewhat different. In terms of components, the game consists of cards, money, worker pawns, resource markers, the provost, and castle building stones. Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck. Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:<BR><BR>build a new building by extending the road<BR>pay 1 to draw a new building card<BR>pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted)<BR>pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards<BR>build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or<BR>pass<BR>Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money).<BR><BR>Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color. When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.<BR><BR>From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.<BR><BR>The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished.

That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov.<BR><BR>Now designer Mark McLaughlin of the award-winning Napoleonic Wars, along with developer Fred Schachter, who together brought you GMT's Wellington, have come together again to produce an energetically fast-paced, highly-interactive game of that 1812 epic. Using the same game system that won acclaim in their previous titles; in this rendition, Mark and Fred have crafted a game that retains the feel of campaigning in the deadly vastness of Russia, yet also plays fast, remains fun and whose outcome is often in doubt right down to last card played and the last die rolled.<BR><BR>Kutuzov 1812: Defending Russia From Napoleon, is designed for two, three or four players. One player or team takes the Imperials, whose Army of the North - with Leaders Napoleon, Ney, Davout and the Prussian Yorck and Army of the South - with Murat, Eugene, Poniatowski and the Austrian Schwarzenberg; must invade and either conquer Russia through occupation of its capitals and key cities, or through decisive battlefield victory break the Russian army's Will to Fight.<BR><BR>One other player or team takes the Tsarist forces, whose First Army - with Leaders Barclay, Constantine, Wittgenstein and later Kutuzov himself and the Second Army - with Bagration, Tormassov, Platov and later that ""Damned Sailor"" Admiral Tchitagov; must not only defend Mother Russia but also later expel the hated invaders from her sacred soil. (No bias here, but after all, the game is called Kutuzov, not Uncle Nappy Goes to Moscow). In games with three or four players, victory goes not just to the winning team, but the player on that team who gains the most points, something that not only enhances competition but also helps recreate the many petty jealousies that plagued the combatants of both sides during this epic campaign.<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/kutuzov1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/kutuzov2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","kutuzov.jpg","",94.60,1,1.30,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2009-04-13 00:00:00,"GMT Games",Active,1,4,2009,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games","War Games",,,,,,

"EGD 2749","Mare Nostrum","From Bruno Faidutti's web site:<BR><BR>I've known Serge Laget for about twenty years, and these last twenty years he has been working on this game, his Opus Major, his life's achievement. The idea is as simple as it is ambitious: a playable Civilization. Since I've never been very fond of Civilization, I didn't take part in the numerous test games of this hackneyed game, and I decided at last to play it only when I heard that it will, at last, be published. Serge claims that his Civilization has only two pages of rules and can be played in two or three hours. I can testify that there are, indeed, only two pages of rules. Our game lasted almost five hours, but it didn't feel that long. The game is bursting with clever and simple systems. Victory can be achieved through military conquest, through trade or through diplomacy and politics. Three games in one, but they are related: politics helps trade, and an army with no economic backup has no real use. Twenty years of fine tuning makes for what is probably the best one in the numerous family of big games played on a map of the Mediterranean and figuring the politic, military and economic rivality between the empires of the antiquity.","marenostrum.jpg","",71.50,2,1.80,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-09-16 00:00:00,"Euro Games",Active,3,5,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games",,,,,,,

The historical three-man council (the first Triumvirate between Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus) could not be renewed at the conference at Luca, and a bitter struggle broke out between the three rivals. Now they seek to eliminate one another, vying to gain supremacy over the empire. But in order to gain power, they must exhibit skill in both politics and military strategy in their quest to the ultimate goal -- individual ascendancy!

There is a crisis -- he left no clear heir to his immense empire and his generals have begun to quarrel. In an effort to prevent further violence a settlement is reached. The generals will divide the empire. Each is given a portion of the vast empire, but for the ambitious generals who commanded the greatest army in the ancient world, this serves only to delay the inevitable. For the next twenty years a series of wars break out that fragments the vast empire that once stretched from Europe to India.<BR><BR>Successors is a strategy game based on those civil wars - Macedonians fighting Macedonians from Europe to Persia. Each player commands two or more generals. Armies are built from a core of trusted Macedonians and augmented with mercenaries and elephants. Players initially fight for control of the royal family members to become the legitimate heir to Alexander's empire, or the regent when the heirs come of age. As time passes, the generals concentrate on carving out their kingdoms from the vast empire and declare themselves Successors!<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/successors1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/successors2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","successors.jpg","",96.40,0,1.55,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2009-04-13 00:00:00,"GMT Games",Inactive,2,4,2009,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games","War Games",,,,,,

The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?</I><BR><BR>In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.<BR><BR>This is a remake of the 1985 Games Workshop classic, Warrior Knights by Derek Carver. It contains new gameplay elements not found in the original version.<BR><BR>Warrior Knight has a very clever mechanic. Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move & attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith. Only 6 of these are done in any turn. Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn. The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players. So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn.<BR><BR>In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task. Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase. Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment. When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services. The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.<BR><BR>The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game. Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected. If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote. These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.<BR><BR><B>Expanded by:</B><BR>Warrior Knights: Crown and Glory<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/warriorknights1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/warriorknights2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","warriorknights.jpg","",70.00,1,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-11-06 00:00:00,"Fantasy Flight Games",Active,2,6,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games","War Games",,,,,,

There are 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a striking bell. The deck is distributed between the players. Hold your deck face down; deal one face up in front of you. As each player reveals their next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck. If you're wrong, pay the others a card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When 2 players are left, they have one more strike, and then the taller deck wins.<BR><BR>An obviously fun game, it actually requires a bit of thought.

They will not be really safe until they reach their Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.<BR><BR>Each player leads a group of pirates to Pirate's Nest on Tortuga. The path leads the pirates through wild jungle and across the waters of open ocean to the island of Tortuga.<BR><BR>In addition to the innate perils of the trip are the other pirates, as each group wants to be the first to arrive at Pirate's Nest and will do what they can to slow the others progress. As soon as one player has all his pirates in Pirate's Nest, he can raise the Jolly Roger and win the game.Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and you move a pirate forward by playing a card and moving ahead to the matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over those where another pirate already stands, but the only way to get more cards is to move backwards.

Every player has a set of ""person"" cards. Each round, you play one card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) Then players choose actions (most of which call on the workers' abilities) to help them prepare for the months ahead. At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.<BR><BR>Careful planning is the key to surviving ""the year of the dragon,"" but survival alone may not win you the game.<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/yearofthedragon1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","yearofthedragon.jpg","",61.80,2,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-11-06 00:00:00,"Rio Grande Games",Active,2,5,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games",,,,,,,

After finishing that turn, the random turn follows where a number of random cards are drawn and executed, throwing the players off track from their plans.

When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.<BR><BR>""The component design in Cleopatra is the most innovative we've undertaken to date,"" said Days of Wonder CEO, Eric Hautemont. ""While it's still a board game, the dozens of 3D pieces - Column walls, Doorframes, Obelisks, Sphinxes, and Palace Throne - all create the sense that you're constructing a royal palace.""<BR><BR>""The game play really forces players into continually weighing the risks and rewards between taking enough corruption to enhance your position in the game, but not so much that you are forced out of the game at the end,"" said the game's co-designer, Bruno Cathala. ""It's a classic 'push your luck' dilemma that continually raises the tension level higher and higher until the game reaches its climax.""<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/cleopatra1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/cleopatra2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","cleopatra.jpg","",72.80,0,2.10,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-12-01 00:00:00,"Days of Wonder",Active,3,5,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games",,,,,,,

Seize power sources and capitals, develop your infrastructure, and build and wield vast, high-tech armies in your bid for global domination. Players will probably recognize the map as that of Earth, but what they will not see are any borders or nations. In the world of Dust, the unending war and the new technologies have altered the political face of Earth beyond all recognition.<BR><BR>At the beginning of each turn, players select a card from their hand. This card represents their strategy for the coming turn and to a large extent dictates the actions a player can take. During their production phase, players spend production points to buy additional factories and units. Each individual unit type has its own unique statistics and effects, so players have to carefully consider the composition of their armies.<BR><BR>In combat, players alternate rolling dice and destroying units until one side has been eliminated (either due to casualties or retreats) or a cease-fire is declared.<BR><BR.At the end of each game round, players score victory points for power sources, capitals, and majorities they control.

The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there's very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.<BR><BR>The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.<BR><BR>Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies.<BR><BR>If the Gnomes can keep alive long enough, rescue will arrive and the game is won.<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/rednovember1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/rednovember2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","rednovember.jpg","",36.40,0,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-12-01 00:00:00,"Fantasy Flight Games",Active,3,8,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games","Card Games",,,,,,

"GMT 0706","Asia Engulfed","<B>Designer: </B><I>Jesse Evans, Rick Young</I><BR><B>Publisher: </B><I>GMT Games</I><BR><B>Players: </B><I>2 Players</I><BR><B>Time:</B> 480 Minutes <BR><B>Age: </B><I>12 and Up</I><BR><BR></B><I>Asia Engulfed is a complete stand alone game or it can be combined with Europe Engulfed to simulate the entire Second World War. A complete set of combined game rules allow for unit transfer, production allocation, and combined victory conditions.<BR><BR>Asia Engulfed focuses on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. Players actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in 6-to-9 hours once players become familiar with its elegant game systems.<BR><BR><B>Wood Block Units:</B><BR>Wood blocks are used for both land and naval units to provide a realistic fog of war. Different colors are used for not only the different nations but also for land and naval units so there is no confusion as to what is what and who is who. Only the controlling player knows where their elusive carriers are until combat is engaged. Players will have to decide during their naval reaction move if they have the guts to intercept the enemy's unknown forces.<BR><BR><B>Supply and Oil:</B><BR>Asia Engulfed incorporates a unique and simple system to realistically portray the Japanese resource limitations. The further your empire expands from Japan the harder it is to supply and operate your far-flung forces, not to mention defend your perimeter with a navy limited by its oil reserves.<BR><BR><B>China, India, and Australia:</B><BR>All three are in play and potential targets for Japanese expansion. Could any of them been captured if Japan had focused its resources? While it isn't likely, they are targets that the Allies have to defend and often seem just out of reach. Optional rules can bring the Soviet Union into the game.<BR><BR><B>Redesigned Air System:</B><BR>Air assets are critical to a successful campaign in the Pacific, influencing both movement and supply. A carefully designed area map allows air units to exert control into adjacent areas and move across areas to the next airbase without having to worry about tracking range or counting hexes. Carrier air assets are represented by their own counters allowing for their losses to be tracked separately from the carriers and for the Japanese to husband their elite pilots.<BR><BR><B>Redesigned Naval System:</B><BR>The naval system is totally redesigned from Europe Engulfed and along with the air system an integral part of Asia Engulfed. Basing limits, extended range movement, naval reaction movement, carrier day or surface ship night combat, surprise effects, port attacks, invasion support, it's all there and when combined with block limited intelligence and a healthy dose of lady luck every engagement brings the thrill of a potential victory and the fear of a devastating defeat. Even submarines get to put in an appearance as they try to pickoff stragglers.<BR><BR><B>Production and Strategic Warfare:</B><BR>Asia Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include Special Actions, Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, Submarines, Land Based Air and Carrier Based Air units, Infantry, Marines, and an assortment of strategic assets. The USA conducts a strategic submarine campaign against the Japanese naval transport system and later in the war is able to direct strategic bombers over Japan.<BR><BR><B>Special Actions:</B><BR>Special Actions are an innovative rule system to allow for not only extended operations during the course of a normal two month game turn but also to represent each sides unique capabilities. From code breaking to emergency rebasing, special actions provide a wealth of options for the player who has been able to commit the necessary resources to build them.<BR><BR><B>Rulebook and Playbook:</B>The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, combined game rules, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play.<BR><BR><I>Asia Engulfed Component List:</I><BR>- One 22"" by 34"" full color cardstock map<BR>- 135 wooden blocks with stickers<BR>- 68 round counters in three sizes<BR>- 228 9/16"" counters<BR>- One 24 page rulebook<BR>- One 24 page playbook<BR>- 24 six sided dice (two sets of 12)<BR>- One air declaration and naval battle-board card<BR>- Several player aid cards <BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/asiaengulfed1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/asiaengulfed2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","asiaengulfed.jpg","",100.50,1,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-12-01 00:00:00,"GMT Games",Active,2,2,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games","War Games",,,,,,

Players choose from Greeks, Romans, and Germanic tribes and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, and Babylonians.<BR><BR>Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) ancient personalities first will win the game!<BR><BR>Lead one of these nations to victory! But watch out for your enemies, as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.<div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/antike1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/antike2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","antike.jpg","",82.50,2,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-12-12 00:00:00,"Rio Grande Games",Active,2,6,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games",,,,,,,

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first-editions handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.<BR><BR>The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in ""time."" So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the ""time"" to catch up.<BR><BR>In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt. When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.<div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/thebes1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/thebes2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","thebes.jpg","",82.50,0,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-12-12 00:00:00,"Rio Grande Games",Active,2,4,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,1,"Board Games",,,,,,,

The game proceeds simultaneously over three different periods. You start the game in the Middle Ages, on the first of the three game boards (that of the commanderies). With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, civil and religious buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys_)<BR><BR>Thanks to the watch makers' invention and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time_ Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.<BR><BR>Playing with time is not without consequences and can produce surprising results! To give just one example, an abbey created on the priories board could be destroyed by a castle built later in the game in the same place, but on the commanderies board, and then moved to the other board_ The abbey finally never existed!<BR><BR>On the 4th and 7th turns, each controlled domain generates profits for the players depending on the board.

In distant Babylon, Queen Amyitis fell homesick, missing the green mountains of her native country.

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.<BR><BR>The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. When a player gets rid of the last of his cards, he makes a mental note of who went out before him for the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked.

One set of controls operates left and right, the other set operates up and down. Now you are competing directly with your partner to get the most apples. Can you grab the premium apples while leaving your partner with wholesale fodder? Can you exploit a rush order, or throw a wrench in the works? Quality control and order mix-ups also add to the fun.<BR><BR>In the end, the player with the most apples in their crates wins.</I><BR><BR>Pick & Pack is a 2-player Strategy game that is easy to learn and typically plays in 15-20 minutes.<BR><BR>36 tiles depicting trays of apples are set up at random on the 6x6 central grid of the board, at the beginning of the game. Each tray contains from 1 to 6 apples. A pawn is placed on the (only) tile with 6 apples. Additionally, the two players each have 12 'action' tiles that they place on rows around the four sides of the grid. Each player has two of each of the following action tiles:<BR><BR>- Premium - doubles the value of a crate of apples<BR>- Wholesale - halves the value of a crate of apples<BR>- Rush Order - stores up an extra move<BR>- Quality Control - allows the player to steal a tray<BR>- Order Mixup - allows the player to swap trays<BR>- Malfunction - allows the player to flip over an unplayed tile<BR><BR>One player plays 'vertically', the other plays 'horizontally'.<BR><BR>On his turn, a player moves the pawn (representing the ""grabber"") to any one of the other 5 spaces in its current row, in his 'direction'. If the space contains a tray of apples, the player removes the tray (leaving the pawn in the empty space) and adds it to one of his 4 crates. If the cell is empty, the player must activate one of his two 'action' tiles at either end of that row.<BR><BR>Play continues until one player's 4 crates are all capped off (with the Premium/Wholesale tiles), or until one player is unable to make a valid move. The players evaluate each of their crates, scoring:<BR><BR>- For open crates - 1 point per apple<BR>- For Premium crates - 2 points per apple- For Wholesale crates - 1 point per 2 apples (rounded down)<BR><BR>The player with the most points is the winner.<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/pickpack1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/pickpack2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","pickpack.jpg","",28.60,0,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-12-13 00:00:00,"Z-Man Games",Active,2,2,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,1,"Board Games",,,,,,,

Gentlemen of the Imperial court, ordinary clerks and functionaries by day, went out at night to meet their secret lovers in furtive trysts. Writing by the light of the moon, each tried to craft the finest and most moving poetry in the form of the Tanka, a short verse composed of only five lines. The best poems evoked the scene, the season, and represented the depth of the courtier's knowledge of the fashionable themes at court. By far, the most successful such lover was a fictional one named Hikaru Genji, the Shining Prince. Genji was, for the ladies of the court, the symbol of the perfect lover. For the men of the court, he was the perfect example to emulate.<BR><BR>In <B>GENJI</B>, players take the roles of courtiers out to woo fair princesses. Players score points for writing the finest poetry, or winning the most hearts. But beware: other courtiers will be waiting in the wings to steal those hearts away! Take your brush in hand, and set out on the night streets of Kyoto. The romance of the height of the Heian Period awaits you in GENJI.<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/genji1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/genji2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","genji.jpg","",29.20,1,0.00,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2008-12-13 00:00:00,"Z-Man Games",Active,2,6,2008,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Card Games",,,,,,,

These wood tokens will be of simple design but still look like a piece of dark brown wood or a branch from a tree (stick). <BR><BR>2.27 dark red pieces.

These generic white food or cat-tail markers will be great for general token replacement. They will be fatter on the bottom and skinnier on the top than the grain tokens but of a similiar look.<BR><BR>4. 20 grey stone counters. They will have a granite/dark gray color to them. <BR><BR>5. 27 yellow wheat counters. These will be yellow like bundles and stand up by themselves. <BR><BR>6. 18 orange carrots or food counters. These will look like carrots, orange and just carrot shaped.<BR><BR>7. 36 additional food markers. These will be in 3 varieties, a simple bread, 12 of these. Also 12 Fish tokens (wooden, fish shaped), and 12 chicken leg / drum stick shaped pieces of meat. <BR><BR>8. 12 Gold markers. These trapazoid shaped gold markers are great for all those euro games that require gold of any sort. These will look like a real gold brick in terms of shape and not a lame yellow cube like most games have in them.<BR><BR>The total number of pieces then is 33 wood, 27 bricks, 15 white tokens, 20 stone, 27 wheat, 12 gold, 18 carrots and 36 additional food (12 each of bread, fish and drum-sticks/chicken leg).

Players are part of a covert team (red, blue, green) that must eliminate one member of an opposing team, but your target is a mystery. At the start of the round, players are randomly dealt a card that depicts one of four characters: sniper, agent, cleaner, mole. The sniper of one team must shoot the sniper of another team to win that round. Problem is, you have to figure out who to shoot without being shot yourself.<BR><BR>As for the other characters, the mole is secretly working for one of the other teams, the agent makes the other team lose if he is shot, and the cleaner must make the shot if the sniper isn't a part of the team. (Two cards are randomly thrown out each round, so a team's sniper might be out of play. The cleaner needs to figure this out by talking with his teammates, but since all discussion is open, they still need to be covert in their talk.) Members of the winning team (or teams, when three teams are in play) receive a score card, and the first player (or players) to receive four cards wins the game. Teams are randomly determined each round, so your back-up man one round may be your target the next. Covert Action sounds utterly simple, yet is difficult to describe succinctly. I look forward to seeing how Frank makes everything clear in the rules.","covert.jpg","",8.50,0,0.13,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2009-01-15 00:00:00,"R&R Games",Active,4,18,2009,N,0.00,N,0,0,1,"Card Games","Party Games",,,,,,

The player with the most money at the end wins.<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/buccaneer1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","buccaneer.jpg","",41.20,2,0.60,1999-11-30 00:00:00,2009-02-19 00:00:00,"Rio Grande Games",Active,3,5,2009,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"Board Games","Family Games",,,,,,

The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore.<BR><BR>The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: ""Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?"" Meaning: will you capture an opponent's piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do?

All those pirates you loved - Black Bart Roberts, Long Ben Avery, Ned Lowe, L'Ollonais, and, of course, Edward Teach (Blackbeard) - 23 in all, are still there, as are the King's Commissioners sent out to stop them. However, the entire play system has been overhauled, and the result is a game that highlights and specializes in player interaction, with almost no down time for any players.<BR><BR>Players represent individual pirates, using them to gain Victory Points by amassing booty and, even more importantly, earning Notoriety for their dastardly deeds. Seizing merchants with cargo ranging from useless paper to the monumental treasure of the Mughal emperors, attacking and sacking ports, fighting storms and scurvy, seeking safe haven in infamous pirate ports such as Tortuga and Madagascar, and, hopefully, using Letters of Marque to retire successfully.<BR><BR>And while the player is doing this, all of the other players, at the same time, are playing their cards and seizing opportunities to stop the pirates. There is a constant interplay among players, and you never know what is going to happen when you set out to do something.<BR><BR>GMT has simplified movement (no more hexes) and ship battles, expanded the use of Royal Navy warships, and even added individual hostages!

Well, at least that's the case in Zeus on the Loose! As you figure out how harness the strengths of the various gods within, you'll sharpen strategic thinking along with valuable addition and subtraction skills. A quick warning about Hera: Though she may be the most powerful goddess in the game, don't get on her bad side or else she might wind up helping an opponent steal Zeus and win!<BR><BR>Catch Zeus if you can!

Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.<BR><BR>After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers.

The island has fascinated travelers, mystics, and scientists for years as people have wondered how such a small, isolated area could have been home to a society that created the world's most spectacular outdoor museum. In the 1940s, Norwegian archaeologist Thor Heyerdahl sailed the reed boat Kon-Tiki from South America to Easter Island to show that the technology available made it possible for Polynesia to be settled from the Americas. In the 1970s, Erich Van Daniken popularized the idea that the world was visited by ancient astronauts and the beautiful and enormous stone statutes, the Moai, of Easter Island were used as some of his ""evidence"".<BR><BR>Today, scientists around the world generally agree that Easter Island was settled from other Polynesian islands to its west, and the extreme culture that produced hundreds of stone Moai is related to other cultures in the region. The history of the island is a history of constraint, and the carving of the Moai, the rapid deforestation of the island, and the limited food sources available all worked together to build an extreme culture that became the victim of its own consumption. In this way, Easter Island today represents more than just a wonderful place to travel, but also is a reminder of the greater resource limits of our entire planet. As populations continue to grow and we put further strains on sources of fuel and food, are we heading toward the same fate that this small island suffered hundreds of years ago? The island today is owned by Chile, and the small population thrives with a few weekly flights to mainland South America and the occasional cargo ship visit.<BR><BR>Moai is a game that closely follows the developments and excesses of the island until the arrival of Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to discover the island and name it for the day of his discovery. Combining many of the historical features of the island's culture in an exciting and well-playing strategic game, players can have fun reliving the dramatic history of this exciting little island.<BR><BR><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/moai1.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5><BR><img src=""http://www.boardgamelifestyle.com/images/moai2.jpg"" width=""250"" vspace=5></div>","moai.jpg","",75.00,1,1.40,2009-08-07 00:00:00,2009-08-06 14:56:32,"Face 2 Face Games",Active,2,5,2009,N,0.00,N,0,0,0,"August New Arrivals","Board Games",,,,,,

Then one player throws the die and turns the sand timer. Which tiles will have to be placed on each players board is determined by the icon on the die. Now each player tries to place their tiles and solve the puzzle as fast as possible. The fastest player shouts ""Ubongo!"" and is allowed to move their pawn on the common game board and take two jewels. Meanwhile the other players continue to solve their puzzle - as long as the sand timer is running, they are allowed to place their tiles and collect jewels. The player who has collected the most jewels of one color is the winner! And that player won't necessarily always be the fastest.","ubongo.jpg","",63.10,14,1.50,1969-12-31 16:00:00,2009-08-24 14:48:18,"Z-Man Games",Active,2,4,2009,N,0.00,N,0,0,2,"August New Arrivals","Board Games","Family Games",,,,,
